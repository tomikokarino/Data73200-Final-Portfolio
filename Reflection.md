# Reflection

I have learned so much while working on the final project and the course tutorials. Though I have a solid background in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I hadn't done real coding in at least five years, and I had no prior experience with d3. So it was a joy to be able to code in a new (to me) language, and made me realize how much I enjoy coding.

The final project ended up very different from my initial idea; I had to accept the fact that I was not adept enough in d3 to execute the original idea.  However, during the process of trying to implement my original idea, I read many online resources on map projections, which was an excellent learning opportunity.  Though my d3 skills are still rudimentary, and I cannot implement complex map projections that require ellaborate transitions, etc, I gained a fundamental understanding of map projections, which I think prepared me for a course on GIS I will take next semester.
