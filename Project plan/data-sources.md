<h2>2020 Human Development Data - UNDP.org</h2>
<p>The Human Development Index is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and having a decent standard of living. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, while the education dimension is measured by the mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more, and the expected years of schooling for children of school entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income (GNI) per capita. The scores for the three HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a composite index using geometric mean. </p>

<p>You can read more about the HDI data and how they are calculated on the <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi" target="_blank">UNDP website</a>, or in <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2020_technical_notes.pdf" target="_blank">the technical note</a>.</p>
