<h1>Final project prospectus</h1>
<p>Maps are commonly used in data visualizations as faithful representations of our physical world. In my final project, I will challenge this notion, and use maps to visualize various forms of inequity around the world by intentionally distorting the shapes of countries in a map to illustrate that certain countries enjoy privileges while the others are often left behind and suffer from the negative consequences of inequalities.</p>
<p>One of the inspirations for this project came from <a href="https://whitney.org/exhibitions/jasper-johns">Jasper Johns: Mind/Mirror, the art exhibition currently on view at Whitney Museum of American Art</a>.  During the early years of his career, Johns incorporated things such as maps, flags, numbers and colors into his paintings to point out that a real world is not the same as a painted map.  By doing so, he challenged the viewer to question the meanings and values associated with these objects/concepts that we often assume are absolute.</p>
<p>Maps are not objective depictions of our physical world, but rather a human construct that evolves over time, and can be distorted depending on the culture, context and perceptions.  As a student in the Data Analysis and Visualization program, I want this project to be an opportunity to think about how maps, numbers and colors play crucial roles in our visualizations while recognizing their semantic development that could in turn affect our perceptions of them.</p>
